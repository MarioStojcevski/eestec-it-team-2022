# How is this project structured?

The project structure currently is as follows, there are 3 main folders:

- `Coding solutions`
- `University Exercises`
- `Code from IT sessions`

In the `Coding solutions` folder you will find folders like `Java`, `Python`, `C`, `C++` and so on. Each solution should be placed in the corresponding folder according to its programming language.

In the `University Exercises` folder you will find folders like `Algorithms and Data Structures`, `Structural Programming`, `Object Oriented Programming`, `Internet Programming`... These folders serve as a database of exercise solutions. When you are ready to contribute your code, this is the first folder you want to start with. If it does not fit in the `University Exercises` then you can place your code in the `Coding solutions` folder.

Finally, there is `Code from IT sessions` folder. In <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">EESTEC LC Skopje</span> we have a weekly meeting facilitated by the IT Coordinator from the current year. All the code from those sessions will be here.
